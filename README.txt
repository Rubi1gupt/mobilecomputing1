About the App
---------------
This is a "HelloWorld" Android App. Through the app, it allows to see the menu for various restaurants.

Here are more details:
- First page has the button to link to the list of restaurants.
- Second page has the list of the restaurants.
- Click on any restaurant shows the detailed menu for the restaurant.
- Buttons for navigation between the pages have been added. From the menu page, we can go to home and list of restaurants page. From list of restaurants page we can go to home page. Up navigation is also supported, so back button leads to last screen.

Compiling and Running
---------------------
HelloWorld.Zip is being provided in the submission. The file can be unzipped and opened through Android Studio. It can then be built and run either on emulator or real device. I have tested it on the emulator Nexus 6 (API_27).
